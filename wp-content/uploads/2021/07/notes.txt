Hi, 
I am full-time freelancer in python programming and data science.
I had done multiple projects on web scraping on different platforms.
I have also made scrapers which are completely automated and robust.
I have gone through your requirements and also inspected the website.
I can deliver your project within the time i.e. 11th July with excellent quality of work.
I am new on this platform but have good work experience and profile on other platforms. 
Below are links to my two different profiles on multiple freelancing portals.

Attaching some of the reviews from my previous projects.





I have completely understood the requirements but still I would like to discuss further in details like do we need to scrape only 310 events or we have more such links
